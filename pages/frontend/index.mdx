# Introduction

Welcome to Scalable UI, where I delve into the essential elements of creating scalable and high-performing user interfaces in a straightforward and precise manner.

## Prerequisites?

Essential Web Skills (HTML, CSS, JS), React, Typescript.

## What?

This isn't your beginner's guide to frontend development. Instead, it's tailored for engineers familiar with core web technologies, who have built small-scale projects and seek to expand their understanding to tackle large-scale products.

## Why Am I doing this?

Embarking on scaling UI development, I encountered a plethora of concepts without a centralized resource offering comprehensive guidance with accessible examples. This blog aims to bridge that gap, benefiting both readers and myself.

### I am staying groundedâ€¦

### And giving backâ€¦

> "When you learn, teach. When you get, give." - Maya Angelou

## What to expect?

I'll present the foundational aspects using a structured approach based on four key questions:
What? Why? What If I donâ€™t? What do I get?

<Steps>
### What?
 
Introduction to the concept.
 
### Why?
 
Why it is important to do this and how it helps us scale UI.

### What if I don't?
 
What you stand to lose if you don't do it.

### What do I get?
 
The value you get from this
</Steps>

I'll cover various crucial building blocks listed below, gradually expanding on them.

## Introduction

I've been working as a Software Engineer for about four (4) years with major focus on frontend (Mainly React). I have always wanted a central place to get all the information you need to build scalable and high performing user interfaces, but this information seems to be scattered across multiple sources hence the reason for this blog.

I see this as an opportunity to re-learn some of the important core concepts of frontend engineering and I am open to feedback so feel free to reach out to me ðŸ˜Š.

Building a frontend project can seem like a daunting task, but by breaking it down into smaller steps, it becomes a manageable process. In this blog post, we'll go through the step-by-step process of building a frontend project from start to finish, which is split up into eleven (11) parts:

With these 11 steps, you can build and deploy scalable and performant user interfaces on Friday and be rest assured that you won't get any call over the weekend to fix an urgent bug in production ðŸ˜‰.

My roll-out plan is to update each section bi-weekly using a top-bottom approach over the period of 2023 calendar year so at any point when you find an empty section, feel free to check back for an update ðŸ˜Š. */}
