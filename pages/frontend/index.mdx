## Introduction

I've been working as a Software Engineer for about four (4) years with major focus on frontend (Mainly React). I have always wanted a central place to get all the information you need to build scalable and high performing user interfaces, but this information seems to be scattered across multiple sources hence the reason for this blog.

My roll-out plan is to update each section bi-weekly using a top-bottom approach over the period of 2023 calendar year so at any point when you find an empty section, feel free to check back for an update ðŸ˜Š.
