# Introduction

Welcome to Scalable UI, where I delve into the essential elements of creating scalable and high-performing user interfaces in a straightforward and precise manner.

## Prerequisites?

Essential Web Skills (HTML, CSS, JS), React, Typescript.

## What?

This isn't your beginner's guide to frontend development. Instead, it's tailored for engineers familiar with core web technologies, who have built small-scale projects and seek to expand their understanding to tackle large-scale products.

## Why Am I doing this?

Embarking on scaling UI development, I encountered a plethora of concepts without a centralized resource offering comprehensive guidance with accessible examples. This blog aims to bridge that gap, benefiting both readers and myself.

### I am staying grounded…

### And giving back…

## What to expect?

I'll present the foundational aspects using a structured approach based on four key questions:
What? Why? What If I don’t? What do I get?

<Steps>
### What?
 
Introduction to the concept.
 
### Why?
 
Why it is important to do this and how it helps us scale UI.

### What if I don't?
 
What you stand to lose if you don't do it.

### What do I get?
 
The value you get from this
</Steps>

I'll cover various crucial building blocks listed below, gradually expanding on them.
