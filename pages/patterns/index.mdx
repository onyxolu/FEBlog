## Introduction

This website is related to the [FrontendMasters workshop on JavaScript Patterns](https://frontendmasters.com/courses/tour-js-patterns/), which is split up into four parts:

<Features />

The content is based on [Patterns.dev](https://www.patterns.dev) - a free online resource on design patterns and component patterns for building powerful web apps with vanilla JavaScript and React.

---

The patterns covered on this website and in the workshop can guide you when facing a problem other developers have encountered many times before, but are not a blunt tool for jamming into every scenario. The goal is to raise awareness to certain patterns, the problems they solve, and their implementation.
