# Static Import

Import code that has been exported by another module

---

### Overview

A statically imported module is a module that's imported with the default `import` keyword.

```js
import module1 from "./module1";
import module2 from "./module2";
import module3 from "./module3";
```

In this case, `module1`, `module2`, and `module3` are statically imported.

---

When a module is statically imported, a bundler traverses all the modules, and bundles them into one file.

Let's say we have four files:

1. `module1.js`, which exports as single function `module1`
2. `module2.js`, which statically imports the named export `module1`, and returns a single function `module2`
3. `module3.js`, which statically imports the named export `module2`, and returns a single function `module3`
4. `index.js`, which statically imports the named export `module3` and logs this value

When we bundle `index.js`, the bundler traverses the modules, and bundles them all together into one single file.

### Implementation

We can import React components from other files.

```js
import Header from "./Header";
import Content from "./Content";

export default function BlogPost({ post }) {
  return (
    <div>
      <Header title={post.title} />
      <Content body={post.body} />
      <Footer />
    </div>
  );
}
```

In this case, `Header` and `Content` are statically imported. The `Header` and `Content` modules get executed as soon as the engine reaches the line on which we import them.

When you open the console, you can see the order in which the modules have been loaded!
