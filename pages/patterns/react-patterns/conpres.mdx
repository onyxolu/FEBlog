# Container/Presentational Pattern

Enforce separation of concerns by separating the view from the application logic.

---

### Overview

We can use the Container/Presentational pattern to separate the logic of a component from the view. To achieve this, we need to have a:

- **Presentational** Component, that cares about **how** data is shown to the user.
- **Container** Component, that cares about **what** data is shown to the user.

For example, if we wanted to show listings on the landing page, we could use a container component to fetch the data for the recent listings, and use a presentational component to actually render this data.

<video
  width="100%"
  height="430"
  autoPlay
  muted
  loop
  src="https://res.cloudinary.com/dq8xfyhu4/video/upload/v1653700248/FM%20Workshop/react-state-patterns/con-pres/Screen_Recording_2022-05-27_at_8.08.53_PM_kyd2eq.mov"
  frameborder="0"
  allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture"
  allowFullScreen
  controls
/>

---

### Implementation

We can implement the Container/Presentational pattern using either Class Components or functional components.

```js
import React from "react";
import { LoadingListings, Listing, ListingsGrid } from "../components";

function ListingsContainerComponent() {
  const [listings, setListings] = React.useState([]);

  React.useEffect(() => {
    fetch("https://my.cms.com/listings")
      .then((res) => res.json())
      .then((res) => setListings(res.listings));
  }, []);

  return <Listings listings={listings} />;
}

function ListingsPresentationalComponent(props) {
  if (props.listings.length === 0) {
    return <LoadingListings />;
  }

  return (
    <ListingsGrid>
      {listings.map((listing) => (
        <Listing listing={listing} />
      ))}
    </ListingsGrid>
  );
}
```

### Tradeoffs

<Callout type="green">
  <b>Separation of concerns</b>: Presentational components can be pure functions
  which are responsible for the UI, whereas container components are responsible
  for the state and data of the application. This makes it easy to enforce the
  separation of concerns.
</Callout>

<Callout type="green">
  <b>Reusability</b>: We can easily reuse the presentational components
  throughout our application for different purposes.
</Callout>

<Callout type="green">
  <b>Flexibility</b>: Since presentational components don't alter the
  application logic, the appearance of presentational components can easily be
  altered by someone without knowledge of the codebase, for example a designer.
  If the presentational component was reused in many parts of the application,
  the change can be consistent throughout the app.
</Callout>

<Callout type="green">
  <b>Testing</b>: Testing presentational components is easy, as they are usually
  pure functions. We know what the components will render based on which data we
  pass, without having to mock a data store.
</Callout>

<Callout type="warning"  emoji="⚠️">
  <b>Not necessary with Hooks</b>: Hooks make it possible to achieve the same result without having to use the Container/Presentational pattern.

For example, we can use SWR to easily fetch data and conditionally render the listings or the skeleton component. Since we can use hooks in functional components and keep the code small and maintainable, we don't have to split the component into a container and presentational component.

```js
import React from "react";
import useSWR from "swr";
import { LoadingListings, Listing, ListingsGrid } from "../components";

function Listings(props) {
  const {
    data: listings,
    loading,
    error,
  } = useSWR("https://my.cms.com/listings", (url) =>
    fetch(url).then((r) => r.json())
  );

  if (loading) {
    return <LoadingListings />;
  }

  return (
    <ListingsGrid>
      {listings.map((listing) => (
        <Listing listing={listing} />
      ))}
    </ListingsGrid>
  );
}
```

</Callout>

<Callout type="warning" emoji="⚠️">
  <b>Overkill</b>: The Container/Presentational pattern can easily be an
  overkill in smaller sized application.
</Callout>

## Exercise

We have a `Listings` component that both contains the fetching logic, as well as the rendering logic. In order to make the fetching logic more reusable, we can split this component up into a container and presentational component.

#### Challenge

Remove the data fetching logic from the `Listings` component, and move this to a separate `ListingsContainer` component located in `/components/container/Listings.tsx`

<StackBlitz
  name="react-ts-mu6zaj"
  openFile="components/presentational/Listings.tsx"
  view="both"
/>

#### Solution

<StackBlitz
  name="react-ts-emrozx"
  openFile="components/container/Listings.tsx"
  view="both"
/>
