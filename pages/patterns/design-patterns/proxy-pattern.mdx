# Proxy Pattern

Intercept and control interactions to target objects

---

### Overview

The **Proxy Pattern** uses a **Proxy** intercept and control interactions to target objects.

Let's say that we have a `person` object. We can access properties with either dot or bracket notation,

  height="430"
  autoPlay
  muted
  loop
  src="https://res.cloudinary.com/dq8xfyhu4/video/upload/v1653361839/FM%20Workshop/design-patterns/proxy-pattern/proxy1_gdxego.mov"
  frameborder="0"
  allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture"
  allowFullScreen
  controls
/>

and modify property values in a similar fashion.

  width="100%"
  height="430"
  autoPlay
  muted
  loop
  src="https://res.cloudinary.com/dq8xfyhu4/video/upload/v1653361839/FM%20Workshop/design-patterns/proxy-pattern/proxy2_px4kua.mov"
  frameborder="0"
  allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture"
  allowFullScreen
  controls
/>

With the Proxy pattern, we don't want to interact with this object directly. Instead, a Proxy object intercepts the request, and (optionally) forwards this to the target object - the `person` object in this case.

### Implementation

In JavaScript, we can easily create a new proxy by using the built-in `Proxy` object.

![Proxy](/design-patterns/proxy-pattern/001.png)

The `Proxy` object receives two arguments:

1. The target object
2. A handler object, which we can use to add functionality to the proxy. This object comes with some built-in functions that we can use, such as `get` and `set`.

The `get` method on the handler object gets invoked when we want to access a property, and the `set` method gets invoked when we want to modify a property.

```js
const person = {
  name: "John Doe",
  age: 42,
  email: "john@doe.com",
  country: "Canada",
};

const personProxy = new Proxy(person, {
  get: (target, prop) => {
    console.log(`The value of ${prop} is ${target[prop]}`);
    return target[prop];
  },
  set: (target, prop, value) => {
    console.log(`Changed ${prop} from ${target[prop]} to ${value}`);
    target[prop] = value;
    return true;
  },
});
```

#### `Reflect`

The built-in `Reflect` object makes it easier to manipulate the target object.

Instead of accessing properties through `obj[prop]` or setting properties through `obj[prop] = value`, we can access or modify properties on the target object through `Reflect.get()` and `Reflect.set()`. The methods receive the same arguments as the methods on the handler object.

### Tradeoffs

<Callout type="green">
  <b>Control</b>: Proxies make it easy to add functionality when interacting
  with a certain object, such as validation, logging, formatting, notifications,
  debugging.
</Callout>

<Callout type="warning" emoji="⚠️">
  <b>Long handler execution</b>: Executing handlers on every object interaction
  could lead to performance issues.
</Callout>

### Exercise

#### Challenge

Add the following validation to the `user` object:

- The `username` property has to be a `string` that only contains of letters, and is at least 3 characters long
- The `email` property has to be a valid email address.
- The `age` property has to be a number, and has to be at least `18`
- When a property is retrieved, change the output to `${new Date()} | The value of ${property}} is ${target[property]}`. For example if we get `user.name`, it needs to log `2022-05-31T15:29:15.303Z | The value of name is John`
